APPLICATION: DATABASE-ENLARGER

THE INTENTION OF THE CREATION OF THIS APPLICATION IS TO ENABLE THE SYSDBA TO MONITOR HIS DATABASES FROM A LOCAL
DAEMON THAT IS CONSTANTLY CHECKING FOR DB DISK SPACE. WHEN THE DISK SPACE REACHES A CERTAIN LIMIT, THE DAEMON WILL
EXECUTE A LIST OF PLANNED PROCEDURES FOR THE DB, IT WILL INITIALLY CREATE A .SQL DUMP FILE OF THE DB, WHICH IS KNOWN
AS AN 'EJEMPLAR' OF THE DB. AFTER DUMP IS GENERATED, THE DB LOGGER TABLE WILL BE TRUNCATED AND IT WILL REMOVE A LOT OF
DISK USAGE IN THE REMOTE SERVER, ALLOWING THIS POSTGRES DB TO NEVER STOP WORKING.

THANK YOU.

BEST REGARDS,
ERICK COBO.
